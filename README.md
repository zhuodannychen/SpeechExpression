## Description
Public speaking is a big problem for many people because they are afraid of stage fright. Causes of stage fright mainly come from fear of public failure or humiliation, either of which may stem from a lack of preparation and not knowing our weaknesses. Oftentimes, when we are preparing for speeches, we are so concentrated on the material and content that we become unaware of the way we deliver it, such as the use of filler words, fluency, and tone. It will be helpful if we are reminded of the small mistakes we make so we can analyze the results and improve on our delivery quality. 

This problem persists for a very large subset of the population.  Most people have to give a rather large speech/presentation at some point in their lives, whether it is a project for their school/college, a part of a meeting for their job, or any other situation where some sort of speech is appropriate.  With each situation for a speech being slightly different, the tools needed to perfect a speech might differ from one person to another.  For example, a motivational speaker might want a utility to assist them with memorizing a speech while an inexperienced high-school student might want features that help them build up their speech and catch common public speaking errors such as an excessive use of “ums” or changes in their intonation and/or talking speed.

As a result, we desire to construct a web application that facilitates these goals by converting their speech to text in real time to allow for live feedback/audio cues depending on what type of feedback is being requested.  With this structure for the web app, the user will need to be in a controlled, quiet environment with access to a computer with both internet connection and a microphone.  For this project, any ethical concerns are very minor as we believe that our product does not motivate unethical deeds from its user.
